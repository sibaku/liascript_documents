# LiaScript documents

This repository will contain various documents utilizing [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/), mainly to explain math and programming.

The documents are written in markdown, so they can be read by any reader, though some contain special functionality for LiaScript.

The target demographics are different, some are kinda for myself to look things up, some are for more experienced programmers, some more for people starting out.
